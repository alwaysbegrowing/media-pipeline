To add additional dependencies, for example other CDK libraries, just add
them to your `setup.py` file and run the `pipenv update -e .`

 * `cdk ls`          list all stacks in the app
 * `cdk synth`       emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
 * `cdk deploy`      deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
 * `cdk diff`        compare deployed stack with current state

Enjoy!
